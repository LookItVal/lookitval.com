  - question: What exactly is this?
    answer: This is a web application that uses a custom machine learning model to identify broad types of bird audio. To use the model just hit the big red button the model will tell you what it hears. The model was trained on a dataset of bird sounds and can recognize various broad categories of birds based on the audio features, location, date and time of the recording. Birds are all this model has ever known. As far as this model is concerned, everything else is a bird.
  - question: How accurate is the model?
    answer: Well for one you could bark at this thing and it would probably tell you something like "Sounds like Owls". This model was designed for an academic report and achieved 95% accuracy on the test set, but the model was not optimized for production use. Biases in the training data and combined with poor audio quality can lead to misclassifications, and the model relies heavilly on the date, time, and location of the recording, so playing a recording for the model is not likely to produce accurate results without accurate audio metadata to come with. This model is not intended for real-world use but rather as a proof of concept for the deployment of small models on the frontend without the use of a backend server.
  - question: "Wait, there is no server?"
    answer: "Correct! This entire application runs in your browser. I wrote the model in python, and pickled the model's weights. This webpage loads a version of python that runs in the browser (Pyodide) and downloads all the dependencies and then my pickled model, then it's sent arrays of audio data and metadata to classify. This is all done on your computer, no data is sent to any server."
  - question: "How did you make this?"
    answer: "There's a write-up coming soon, but for now you can check out the github repo on the model architecture [here](https://github.com/LookItVal/FinalProject/blob/master/revised_final.ipynb) and the repo for this web app [here](https://github.com/LookItVal/lookitval.github.io)."
