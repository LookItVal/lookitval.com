# ยง I: Introduction

Bird species classification based on audio recordings has significant implications for ecological monitoring, biodiversity studies, and conservation efforts, as well as being applicable and interesting to a population of bird watchers and nature lovers. This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning pipeline capable of identifying bird species from basic metadata recordable by a smartphone. By leveraging audio signal processing techniques and modern classification algorithms, the project aims to create a reliable and scalable solution for bird call recognition. :u-i-footnote{note='Would you believe me if I said this was not written by AI?' icon='1'}

## A. Overview of project goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Integration:

Analyze problems with the audio files and reduces those problems with techniques for noise reduction, and compare how a data preprocessing step effects the success of different classification models.

### 2. Feature Engineering:

Extract meaningful features from raw audio signals, including frequency-domain representations, time-frequency representations, and reprocess the signal to make the target sound the loudest part of the signal.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation:

Train and compare multiple classification models, including neural networks and traditional classification algorithms, to identify the most effective approach for bird call classification.

### 4. Practical Application:

Build a functional tool capable of processing new audio files to classify bird species throughout an audio file. :u-i-footnote{note='At the time of turning this in, I actually had not done this part, but now I have! You can check it out [here](/bird-recognition).' icon='2'}
